# Resources
This will be a repository containing different techniques, pipelines and cheatsheets that I have worked with or I have seen elsewhere. The purpose is for this repository to contain information that may be useful for myself and any others that are interested in topics I'm familiar with. Most of these resopurces will be work from other people,
